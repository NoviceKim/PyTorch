    "- Augments Neural Network with *Visual Attention* mechanism.\n",
    "- STN is a generalization of differentiable attention that can be applied in any spatial transformation.\n",
    "- STN learns what spatial variations should be performed on input images to enhance the *geometric invarience* of Neural Networks.\n",
    "- Since CNN is sensitive about the inputs that are affine-transformed, STN should be very useful mechanism to overcome this issue.\n",
    "- One of the advantages of STN is that it can be easily connected to existing CNN models with very small modifications."
